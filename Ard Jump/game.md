We're making a game for a code jam. it's a mini game that includes web3 blockchain functionality. It will be on Ardgames, Ardcoin app game section that has many mini games. This app will use ardcoin as a currency. It's a jumper game. the world building is 2D and similar to mario. Let's start with the homepage.

This game will be written in python and fast api. Phone landscape size. webapp. Recommend me other technologies to use.

Also, it should not be hackable, people will play it from web. And it will be integrated into an app.

On single player:
game setting is similar to mario. we go forward until the finish line. if we hit the side of an obstacle we bounce back. it we hit the bottom of an obstacle, we get thrown down. we have 3 lives. if we fall into void we lose a life and start from the start. if we lose all lives, we lose the game.

game movement is only jumps, only one finger needed. tap for longer and the player gains power bar and jumps when tap is released. jump distance and height is determined by power bar gained. power bar is a vertical bar near the character. 


Homepage:
Character is in the middle like pubg. at the left top is a button to top up the balance "Цэнэглэх", under that is a button for skin pull, which will work like chest pull in cs2. at the top right is coin count. and under the coin count is a button that leads to skin inventory. at the right bottom is a button labeled "Эхлэх". leave the buttons functionless, we will work on that later. make something that looks good. we will work on the center avatar skin later.

When "Эхлэх" is pressed:
A window shows up that has 2 buttons, "Single player" on top, "Multiplayer" at the bottom


Multiplayer:

we will race with a bot. remove the timer. keep the progress bar, show both players on the progress bar. we will talk about how good the bot will be later. now just make him 50% accurate in jump accuracy and timing. and add other additional things by your taste
